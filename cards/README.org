#+TITLE: Cards
* Introduction
Copy the YAML code to the GUI editor to setup these card examples.

* Bin Collection Week - bin-collection-week.yaml
The YAML for this card will display the bin collection type for the week - eg.
Green or Yellow - where the local council bin collection alternates between the
two bin types.

- bin_day - Set this variable to the bin collection day (0 - Sunday, 1 - Monday,
  ..)

Change the Green/green and Yellow/yellow settings in the 'if' statement to
reflect which week is which (odd/even).
